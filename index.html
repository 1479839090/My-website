            <figcaption>This is the picture with me and my leader when I worked as an IT intern at Vancouver School
                Board in the summer in 2018. My main task was to help staff to solve computer issues such as replacing
                hardware, unlocking software and building internet. I really enjoyed the time
                with my leader because he had taught me a lot. For example, he introduced me his working environment and
                gave me chances to solve problems on my own.
