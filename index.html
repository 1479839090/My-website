            <figcaption>This is the picture with me and my leader when I worked as an IT intern at Vancouver School Board in the summer in 2018. My main task was to help staff to solve computer issues such as replacing hardware, unlocking software and building internet. I really enjoyed the time 
                with my leader because he had taught me a lot. For example, he introduced me his working environment and  gave me chances to solve problems on my own.
